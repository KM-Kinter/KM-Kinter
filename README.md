# Hey there! I'm Kinter ðŸ‘‹

Fullstack developer with a passion for building and tinkering.

## About Me

I enjoy creating software and exploring the world of hardware. I'm always looking to learn new technologies and solve interesting problems. 
Sometimes I break things just to see how they work (and then fix them, hopefully).
My code works, but I'm not sure why.
