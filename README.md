# Hey there! I'm Kinter ðŸ‘‹

Fullstack developer by day, hardware hacker by night. Currently working on a competition stopwatch based on the HUB75 and RPi Pico.

## What I'm actually good at

- Built an e-commerce site with Django as a great learning experience
- Constantly experimenting with Python to make my life easier (my scripts have saved me hundreds of hours of tedious work)
- Created my own smart home system that not only controls lighting but also adapts to my habits
- Always tinkering with 3D printers, finding and solving problems the manufacturer doesn't even mention in the manual

## Current obsessions

- Starting my journey with React and Next.js because static websites are prehistoric
- Learning VHDL for digital circuit design (because FPGA programming is a completely different beast than regular coding)
- 3D modeling and printing everything I can't find in stores or is too expensive
- Repurposing old things into new, better ones using zero waste methods (recently turned an old monitor into a smart mirror)
- Building a multi-platform music server (Airplay, Spotify, and all popular streaming services) on a Raspberry Pi Zero
